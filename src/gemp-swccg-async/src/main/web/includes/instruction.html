<h1>Manual</h1>

<p>Gemp-Swccg is an automatic game client for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. Below you will
    find basic information about using it.</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>The Game Hall</b><br/>
        A place where everything starts. When you log in, you automatically enter Game Hall.
        Same thing happens when you win/lose game. Basically you can communicate here with
        other players, create decks, create and join games, etc.
    </li>

    <li><b>Building the Deck</b><br/>
        Making a deck is very easy. In the Game Hall you will find "Deck Builder" button. Simply click it and
        the deck builder will open. At the very top of the screen you will buttons and other controls that allow you
        to manage your deck(s). You can create a new deck, save or rename currently edited one, or open an existing
        deck.<br/>
        To the right side you can find cards which could be added to your deck. To the left side
        is what actually your deck consists of.<br/>
        The right hand side allows you to filter the available cards by various criteria - side, name, type, etc.
        You can select multiple criteria and all cards matching these will be displayed below. If there is more cards
        matching that could be displayed at one time, a next (and previous) page button above will allow you to browse
        other pages. Between the next and previous button you will find slider that allows to adjust the number of cards
        displayed on each page.<br/>
        The displayed card size makes it very difficult to read the card text, therefore you can zoom in on the card by
        pressing Shift+click on the card. The same option is available without any keyboard interaction by dragging the
        card
        in the "up" direction (press left mouse button on the card then without releasing the mouse button move your
        mouse up/forward,
        then release the mouse button). Once you're done with viewing the zoomed card, just click anywhere on the
        screen.<br/>
        Once you find a card you wish to add to your deck, just left-click it to move the card to your deck - in the
        center part of
        the screen. If you wish to remove a card from your deck, just left-click it.<br/>
        Underneath the deck you will find information about the deck you're building/viewing - number of cards
        and if the deck is valid in supported formats. If the deck is not valid in some format, the information why it's
        not valid is available.
    </li>

    <li><b>Setting up the game</b><br/>
        Once you have created the deck, you can start playing. You can create a new game by clicking on Create Table
        or join an existing table by clicking on Join Table. Each table displays the format the player wants to play,
        also when you create a table you have to select the format you wish to play from the first drop-down. When you
        create
        or join an existing table, you have to choose your deck from the second drop-down.<br/>
        Once there are two people at the table (one created the table, and one joined it) the game starts. Once the game
        starts other people might go over and view your game by clicking on Watch Game button.
    </li>

    <li><b>Playing the game</b><br/>
        Playing Star Wars Customizable Card Game via Gemp is similar to the one played in real life.
        In most cases cards eligible to play at the current moment will be
        highlighted. If you don’t want to do anything, click Pass and the next step will commence.<br/>
        The Settings tab allows you to change some basic settings of the game - whether to automatically pass if no
        phase
        actions are available to you or not, and also if each card/action selection has to be confirmed or not. It's
        highly
        recommended to de-select this checkbox if you're playing on touch-screen devices to prevent
        accidental card selection.
        The displayed card size makes it very difficult to read the card text, therefore you can zoom in on the card by
        pressing Shift+click on the card. During a game this also displays the current card's live stats (including modifiers).
        The same option is available without any keyboard interaction by dragging the card
        in the "up" direction (press left mouse button on the card then without releasing the mouse button move your
        mouse up/forward,
        then release the mouse button). Once you're done with viewing the zoomed card, just click anywhere on the
        screen.<br/>
    </li>

    <li><b>Player stats</b><br/>
        During a game you can see each player name on the top-left of the window. To the right of the name you can find
        "chess-clock" for that player.
        This time measures time it took for that player to make decisions in game (like in chess). If the time for the
        player runs out, that
        player automatically concedes the game (loses). Directly below the player name you will see an icon with a
        number, this represents: hand size. Also next to them you will see an extra button with a plus (+)
        sign, that allows you to get extra data about that player's force generation and cards out of play.<br/>
        You can browse your own or opponent's out of play cards by clicking on the icon.
    </li>

    <li><b>The Iron Rule</b><br/>
        There is no rolling back, simple as that. You can’t undo an action that already happen, even if
        opponent will agree. If you played cards you didn’t want to, performed the wrong action, or didn’t trigger
        optional action it’s done and can’t be reversed. If you do mistakes like that often, you might consider
        unchecking the "Auto-accept after selecting action or card" checkbox in Settings tab.
    </li>

    <li><b>Useful Stuff</b><br/>
        On the upper part of the game hall, you will find many tabs with useful information.
    </li>
