                format (constructed or sealed).
                Most leagues will have the same format throughout the whole duration of it, but there is a chance of
                getting a mixed format <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b>.
            </li>
            <li><b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> starts at an announced date and lasts until specified number of <b

                table with a deck, that
                deck is set at that point and any changes done to the deck afterwards, will not be reflected in the game
                on that table. If you wish to use a different deck for that game before it starts, leave and rejoin a
                table after modifying your deck.
            </li>
            <li>(SEALED) In case of Sealed format, only virtual product owned within that League can be used to build a

            <li>Cheating includes, but is not limited to - entering <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> with more than
                one account, knowingly
                exploiting a system or a card bug, game fixing (deciding the outcome of a rated game in other way than

        F.A.Q.
        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Can I trade cards in a Sealed league?</b><br/>
                Cards in a Sealed League cannot be traded. The point of having a Sealed league is to provide players
                with limited (semi-random)
                access to card pool for building their deck. This, in theory, should give everyone fair chance of
                winning, based only on deck-building and play-skill.
            </li>
            <li><b>When will I get new boosters in a Sealed league?</b><br/>
                New product in a Sealed league is given at the beginning of each Serie. This is done automatically.
            </li>
            <li><b>How do I join a league?</b><br/>
                In "Leagues" tab click "See details" for the league you are interested in and then click on the "Join league" button.
                If you had enough currency in your account, you will be added to the league.
                In case of sealed league, you need to select the league collection in your deck builder
                (showing "All cards" by default) to build the deck. To open the packs you see there, just left-click
                them.
